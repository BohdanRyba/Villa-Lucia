							seaside that is untouched yet by beton but preserved by our nature.

							leading restaurant nearby the Villa that is known for serving fresh
							fish, as our family formerly was a family of fishers that is known
							throughout the Island. </p>

							utmost hospitality and kindness. Eventually our guests will start feeling
							native to this wonderful Island, which is why many come back again year
							after year. Maybe you too will feel native to this place at some point
							aswell, and we would be very happy to be able to be a part of this.</p>
